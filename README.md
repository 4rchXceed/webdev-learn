# [THIS IS AN OLD PROJECT I MADE FOR A SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT (1st YEAR OF STUDIES), SO NO SERIOUS THINGS HERE]

## What is it?
This is a shitty website made to help learning PHP and Python basics.
It contains all-in-browser interpreters for both languages, made with the help of [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) and [PHP-WASM](https://github.com/seanmorris/php-wasm).

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- No server needed, everything runs in the browser
- You don't even need to install anything, just open the HTML file in your browser
- Runs offline (except the php in html version)

### Cons
- No syntax highlighting
- Shitty learning experience compared to a real course


### Conclusion

This is just a toy project I made for fun and to learn some basics of web development and interpreters.

Don't use this for serious learning, there are way better resources out there.

## How to use
Download or clone the repository, then open `index.html` in your browser.
